This is not the case with CSS, the value is comparable with the browser default\r\nfont Times New Roman. Which concrete pixel value the browser uses, however, is not\r\nclearly defined, there are not 12 pixels as is often claimed, and the more frequently\r\nencountered 16 pixels are not a guarantee.\r\nFigure 1-5 shows the default font (here Firefox) actually used 16 pixels for the letter\r\n\u201cM\u201d and this is equivalent to specifying 16 px. The red line is 16 pixels wide. As font size\r\nwas adjusted to 1 em or 16 px at this screenshot,the achieved result is the same.",
